    <p><b>Abstract</b>: Chemotactic guiding by chemical gradients is important because of possible applications in targeted delivery. In addition, the experimental demonstration of microscale non-reciprocal interactions in active systems is fundamentally important. 
      We developed a microchannel architecture that allows reactive particles to be exposed to imposed chemical gradients for a long time under flow-free conditions. Using this setup, we show that particles functionalized with different enzymes show positive 
      chemotactic mobility in response to their respective substrate gradients. Most significantly, when combined, both acid phosphatase- and glucose oxidase-functionalized particles exhibit chemotaxis in response to a gradient of glucose-6-phosphate, which 
      acid phosphatase converts to glucose, the substrate for glucose oxidase. These findings underscore the significance of chemical gradients in directing particle movement, offering insights crucial for understanding swarming and signaling in living systems. 
      The work also constitutes the first step in designing populations of particles with distinct functions that coordinate their behavior.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: The achievement of consistent and static chemical gradients is critically important in the study of diffusion and chemotaxis at the micro- and nanoscales. In this context, a number of groups have reported on hydrogel-based systems 
      for generating concentration gradients. Here, we analyze the behavior of agarose and gelatin-based hydrogels in hybridization chambers of different heights. Our focus is on the issues that are caused by the presence of robust bulk fluid flows in such 
      systems due to the solutes present in the hydrogel and/or the surrounding fluid. We describe the key insights derived from these experiments, offering practical guidelines for establishing gradients using hydrogel-based systems and make the community 
      aware of different variables that can make the experiments nonreproducible and prone to misinterpretations.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: The dynamic interplay between the composition of lipid membranes and the behavior of membrane-bound enzymes is critical to the understanding of cellular function and viability, and the design of membrane-based biosensing platforms. 
      While there is a significant body of knowledge about how lipid composition and dynamics affect membrane-bound enzymes, little is known about how enzyme catalysis influences the motility and lateral transport on lipid membranes. Using enzyme-attached lipids 
      in supported bilayers (SLBs), we provide direct evidence of catalysis-induced fluid flow that underlies the observed motility on SLBs. Additionally, by using active enzyme patches, we demonstrate the directional transport of tracer particles on SLBs. 
      As expected, enhancing the membrane viscosity by incorporating cholesterol into the bilayer suppresses the overall movement. These are the first steps in understanding diffusion and transport on lipid membranes due to active, out-of-equilibrium processes 
      that are the hallmark of living systems. In general, our study demonstrates how active enzymes can be used to control diffusion and transport in confined 2-D environments.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: Cells are complex chemical systems capable of sensing and responding to environmental cues by dynamically reshaping themselves, e.g., by forming arm-like protrusions such as filopodia. 
      Recapitulating cellular behavior in artificial systems is a long-standing goal in understanding the matter-to-life transition and designing responsive soft materials. Here, we use oil-in-water emulsions that mimic cellular 
      environmental sensing and form directional arm-like filopodia in response to external chemical cues. Our work analyzes the step-by-step process involved in the formation of artificial filopodia, and we engineer ways to direct 
      filopodia growth through different chemical gradients. The process is driven by asymmetric surfactant partitioning across the oil–water interface, followed by ordering at the interface to form lamellar structures, which are 
      projected out as filopodia. We observe filopodia growing away from the source of kosmotropic anions and toward the source of chaotropic anions from the Hofmeister series. Significantly, these systems also respond to amino acid gradients, 
      similar to cells: tryptophan gradients favor growth toward the source, while lysine and arginine gradients cause growth away from the amino acid source. Our findings open new avenues for fabricating life-like materials that sense and grow 
      in response to external signals.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: In the presence of appropriate substrates, surface-anchored enzymes can act as pumps and propel fluid through microchambers. Understanding the dynamic interplay between catalytic reactions and fluid flow is vital to enhancing 
      the accuracy and utility of flow technology. Through a combination of experimental observations and numerical modeling, we show that coupled enzyme pumps can exhibit flow enhancement, flow suppression, and changes in the directionality (reversal) 
      of the fluid motion. The pumps’ ability to regulate the flow path is due to the reaction selectivity of the enzymes; the resultant fluid motion is only triggered by the presence of certain reactants. Hence, the reactants and the sequence in which 
      they are present in the solution and the layout of the enzyme-attached patches form an “instruction set” that guides the flowing solution to specific sites in the system. Such systems can operate as sensors that indicate concentrations of reactants 
      through measurement of the trajectory along which the flow demonstrates a maximal speed. The performed simulations suggest that the solutal buoyancy mechanism causes fluid motion and is responsible for all of the observed effects. More broadly, our 
      studies provide a new route for forming self-organizing flow systems that can yield fundamental insight into nonequilibrium, dynamical systems.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: Nanoscale enzymes anchored to surfaces act as chemical pumps by converting chemical energy released from enzymatic reactions into spontaneous fluid flow that propels entrained nano- and microparticles. Enzymatic pumps are biocompatible, 
      highly selective, and display unique substrate specificity. Utilizing these pumps to trigger self-propelled motion on the macroscale has, however, constituted a significant challenge and thus prevented their adaptation in macroscopic fluidic devices and 
      soft robotics. Using experiments and simulations, we herein show that enzymatic pumps can drive centimeter-scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories. In these studies, the sheets are confined to the air/water interface. 
      With the addition of appropriate substrate, the asymmetric enzymatic coating on the sheets induces chemically driven, buoyancy flows that controllably propel the sheet's motion on the air/water interface. The directionality and speed of the motion can be 
      tailored by changing the pattern of the enzymatic coating, type of enzyme, and nature and concentration of the substrate. This work highlights the utility of biocompatible enzymes for generating motion in macroscale fluidic devices and robotics and indicates 
      their potential utility for in vivo applications.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self-powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non-equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations 
      and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil-in-water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration 
      of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side-view optical microscopy. We propose that the changes in the interfacial tension 
      of the oil droplets is due to the partitioning of the surfactant into the oil phase and the movement of self-emulsified oil out of the parent droplets giving rise to the rhythmic variation in droplet contact-line. The ability to control and understand droplet 
      oscillation can help model similar oscillations in out-of-equilibrium systems in nature and reproduce biomimetic behavior in artificial systems for various applications, such as microfluidic lab-on-a-chip and adaptive materials.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: Controlled release formulations help to encapsulate agrochemicals and deliver at a sustained rate. Growing environmental challenges have increased the need for controlled release systems based on sustainable feed-stocks. 
      To this end, we report here the preparation and properties of a monolith-type controlled release granular formulation based on two ubiquitous biopolymers, starch and cellulose. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) derived from waste sugarcane bagasse 
      were mixed with gelatinized maize starch and urea formaldehyde to yield nanocomposite granular formulation. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) was used as model encapsulant. The morphology of CNFs and CNF-reinforced starch granules was characterized by 
      transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, BET porosimetry, and X-ray tomography. Incorporation of only 2–4 wt % CNFs led to a significant reduction in porosity as compared to that for neat starch granules, while the water 
      uptake was enhanced by 20–30%. Reinforcing starch with CNFs led to a significant reduction in initial release rate and yet higher overall release of DMP, thereby allowing effective utilization of entrapped chemicals. This interesting release behavior 
      could be attributed to two competing factors, water uptake-induced diffusion and barrier effects rendered by nanocellulose network.</p>
