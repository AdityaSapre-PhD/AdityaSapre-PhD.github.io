<h2>INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
<h3>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals — Formulation Development Group (2024–2024)</h3>
<p>
• Product Development: Worked with small molecule and product development teams to understand the application of Antibody–Drug Conjugates (ADCs) into diverse drug product formulations.
• Process Development: 
• Analyzed solubility trends of 20+ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) via PEG-induced liquid-liquid phase separation, assessing cloud point temperature and hydrodynamic sizes. 
• Collaborated with process development teams to achieve a 2-fold reduction in reducing lyophilization times for drug formulations under clinical development.
• Process Optimization: Applied cGMP standards and DOE principles to assess the photostability trends of formulations, improving drug product quality and efficacy.
• Analytical Method Development: Optimized ADC analytical testing protocols with Solo-VPE, SEC, HPLC, ICE, and MFI to assess photo-degradation and excipient impact.
• Data Analysis: Reduced the solubility and stability data analysis time by 10-fold through implementation of AI tools and Visual Basic 6.0 scripts. 
• Technical Documentation: Proficient in ELN, Empower, and LIMS for efficient data management and regulatory compliance.
• Soft Skills Gained: Worked with different teams at Regeneron and understood the importance of cross-functional collaboration, fast-paced work culture and learning, team working, initiative. Improve scientific report writing and documentation by participating in technical-writing workshops.
</p>

<h3>Airgas – An Air Liquide Company (2019)</h3>
<p>
• Process Development:  Designed and executed a lab-scale inert-gas sample storage process using a glove-bag set-up to maintain protein stability during sample handling.
• Process Optimization: Conducted light scattering and spectroscopy experiments and applied DOE principles to optimize protein-gas-liquid interactions for sample storage.
• Analytical Method Development: Developed an inert-gas-based solvent saturation method, reducing protein aggregation by 5-7-fold proteins such as IgG and Chymotrypsinogen using DLS and fluorescence spectroscopy.
• Data Analysis: Accelerated the analysis of time-temperature-resolved DLS datasets by 4-fold using MATLAB scripts.
• Technical Documentation: Performed precise technical documentation and reporting experimental data, methodologies, and findings to ensure compliance with industrial reporting standards.
• Soft Skills Gained: Collaborated with different groups at Airgas and NC State University. Presented data on-schedule to diverse cross-functional teams and well-documented the obtained results demonstrating strong written and verbal communication skills, reliability, accountability, and time management.
